# Real Market

**Reputation-Driven Prediction Market with Proof-of-Personhood**

## ðŸ”¹ Idea Overview

Real Market is a next-generation **prediction market** designed to address the limitations of existing platforms.

- **Proof-of-Personhood:** Ensures that every participant is a verified, unique individualâ€”preventing bots and Sybil attacks.
- **Reputation Scoring:** Influence is not based only on capital. Users gain reputation through consistent, accurate predictions, giving more weight to trusted forecasters.
- **Privacy-Preserving Identity Layer:** Participants can prove attributes such as jurisdiction or age without disclosing sensitive dataâ€”enabling compliance and user protection.

This results in a **smarter, more trustworthy, and regulation-ready prediction market**.
